## HEAT EQUATION

### Summary

Solution of the one-dimensional heat equation on the GPU by the iterative method with X-parallelization and the triangle method. 
This method makes efficient use of shared memory and emphasizes thread synchronization within a block rather than global synchronization.

See report.odt for a full description and/or comments in the code.
